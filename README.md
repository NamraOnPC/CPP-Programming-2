# CPP-Programming-2

Copying any of the code and the logic of the code would result in you getting plagiarised. Instead of copying, understand on the logic and work on the code yourself. read books and watch videos, take guidance from your professor and friends, if you still don't get your code right; Leave Programming. :)
